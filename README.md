# DiscordBot

## Description

To make it easier to add new stuff to my discord bot i've reworked the core. By implementing features as component subclasses the bot can expanded without the need for extensive editing to the main class. 

## Usage

To run the bot you'll need access to a discord server with admin privilidges. By running main.py the bot will start. In config valid information to a mongoDB cluster need to be provided aswel as a discord application token. This token should not be shared.

### ps

Current token in config.ini is no longer valid. A new token can be generated by registering a discord application on the official website.
